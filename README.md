## Bedrock Development

---

### Problem #1
Restarting Minecraft every two minutes to reload pack files is obnoxious.
### Problem #2
I want my packs to be version-controlled with git.
### Problem #3
I want multiple copies of a world to use the same packs.

---

### Solution
Use the `development_behavior_packs` and `development_resource_packs` folders.

---

### Problem #4
Exporting the world doesn't include its packs.
### Problem #5
Importing a world with packs requires manually extracting them to the development folders.

---

### Solution
This program.
